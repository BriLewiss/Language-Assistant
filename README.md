# Language-Assistant
This repository contains a Python script that integrates Google Speech Recognition, Azure Cognitive Services, and OpenAI's GPT-3 to create a speech-based interactive language assistant. The assistant listens to spoken input, generates a response using a custom GPT-3 model built through Azure services, and synthesizes the response into spoken output using Azure Speech Service.

The AI response system is currently tailored to act as an imaginary friend for young children, discussing topics like marine animals and dinosaurs, with simple phrases in both English and Spanish.
